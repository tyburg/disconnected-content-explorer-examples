  Disconnected Interactive Content Explorer (DICE) is an app for iOS, Android, and Windows that allows users to load and view interactive content created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript on a mobile device without a network connection.
  DICE can be used by disaster response personnel, urban search-and-rescue teams, and others that need interactive content to facilitate their efforts when cell towers may be down.
