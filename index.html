  <p class="gap-top">DICE can be used by disaster response personnel, urban search-and-rescue teams, and others that need interactive content to assist with their tasks but the cell towers may be down. No content is included in the app. It must be loaded. The app is simply a container that can parse and display interactive content in a web browser on a disconnected device.</p>
  <p>Below are some example zip files that you can load up and view in the app.</p>
